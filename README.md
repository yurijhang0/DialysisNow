# DialysisNow

Dialysis is a critical treatment for patients with declining kidney functionality. However, it can be difficult
to locate dialysis centers and/or assess the availability of that center for treatment, especially in times of crisis 
(such as during natural disasters). 
DialysisNow is an application that aims to provide a central database of
dialysis centers within the United States.
The application will provide navigational components, as well as give
users the capability to report closures of certain dialysis centers
during times of crisis. This will allow other users to avoid wasting
valuable time searching a multitude of centers to find treatment.
